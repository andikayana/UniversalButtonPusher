# UniversalButtonPusher

This project is a button pusher that help push buttons on a remote control or anything else whenever the user is not able to do so themselves. This button pusher itself can be controlled through an accessibility switch, eye-gaze, voice recognition, etc. Any method that is convenient.

The .ino file runs on an Arduino and controls the servos.
The .pde file runs in Processing on your computer as a means to more easily calibrate the servo positions. Your computer and Processing are not used at all and are unnecessary in the normal usage of the button pusher.
